# Project Overview

This project is a second iteration of a simple static webpage created to demonstrate the basic principles of HTML and CSS. The previous version featured a red title that read 'Version 1.0'. Building on that foundation, this version introduces some updates to the page elements, reflecting the progression of the project. Specifically, the title is now changed to 'Version 2.0' and its color has been modified from red to blue. In addition to the title, a subtitle 'Updated Successfully' has been added to indicate the successful implementation of the changes. This project will continue to serve as a testament to the simplicity and efficiency of static web pages, which can be built upon to develop more complex dynamic websites.

# Requirements

The revised project maintains the requirement of an h1 element with the id 'title', but now the text content should be 'Version 2.0' and its color should be blue instead of red. The updated requirement ensures that the developer can modify existing HTML elements and CSS properties according to project requirements. Furthermore, a new requirement has been added: an h2 element with the id 'subtitle', containing the text 'Updated Successfully'. This new element demonstrates the ability to add more semantic HTML elements to the page, contributing to its structure and meaning.

# Installation & Setup

No specific installation or setup is required for this project as it is a standalone HTML file. However, to view the webpage, users will need a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari. Users can open the HTML file in their web browser by locating the file in their local directory and double-clicking on it. Alternatively, users can right-click on the file, select 'Open With', and choose their preferred web browser.

# Usage Instructions

Upon opening the HTML file in a web browser, users will see a blue title stating 'Version 2.0' and a subtitle underneath it saying 'Updated Successfully'. Due to the static nature of the webpage, there are no interactive elements or additional pages to navigate. The purpose of this webpage is to demonstrate the fundamental principles of HTML and CSS in a simple and efficient manner.

# Technical Details

This simple static webpage is built using HTML5 and CSS3. The HTML5 provides the page structure with h1 and h2 elements, while the CSS3 is used to style these elements. The HTML elements are identified with unique ids, which are then used to apply specific styles in the CSS. The webpage does not use any external libraries or frameworks, demonstrating how a basic webpage can be built using pure HTML and CSS.

# Troubleshooting

As this is a simple static webpage with minimal features, there are few possible issues that could arise. If the webpage does not display correctly, users should ensure that they are opening the file in a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and CSS3. If the title or subtitle does not display correctly, users should check for any typos in the HTML or CSS code.
