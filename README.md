# Project Overview

This project aims to create a simple yet efficient web page that displays 'Version 1.0' as its title, written in red color. The web page is a single, standalone HTML document with embedded CSS for styling purposes. The primary intent behind this project is to demonstrate the efficiency and simplicity of static web pages, which can serve as the foundational building blocks for more complex dynamic websites in the future. By adhering to the project's requirements, a developer can showcase their understanding of basic web development principles such as HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design.

# Requirements

The project has a single, straightforward requirement: to create an h1 element with the id 'title' and color it red. This requirement ensures that the developer can create semantic HTML elements, correctly assign unique identifiers to these elements, and style them using CSS. The id attribute is essential as it allows developers to style and manipulate specific elements, while the h1 tag represents the most important heading on the page, often used for the main title.

# Installation & Setup

To view the project, a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge is required. As the project is a simple HTML file, no server setup or installation is necessary. To open the project:

1. Download the HTML file.
2. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Double-click on the file. It will open in your default web browser.

To edit the file:

1. Download a text editor such as Sublime Text, Atom, or Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the HTML file in the text editor.
3. Make the desired changes and save the file.

# Usage Instructions

The use of this web page is as simple as it gets due to its static nature. Once it is opened in a web browser, you will see a title saying 'Version 1.0' in red color. This title can represent the version of a software product, a section of a website, or any other digital content that requires a version number. Despite its simplicity, the web page follows web standards and has a responsive design, ensuring a consistent viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

# Technical Details

The project is a straightforward single HTML page. It uses pure HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. The project doesn't use any JavaScript as it is not required for the current requirements. However, JavaScript can be added later if dynamic functionality is needed. The responsive design is achieved through the use of relative units in CSS and the meta viewport tag in HTML.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the page, one of the most common problems might be that the HTML file is not correctly saved or that the file's path is incorrect. Ensure that the file is saved with a '.html' extension and that you're opening the correct file in your web browser. If the title is not displayed in red color, check the CSS in the `style` tag to make sure that the color property is correctly set to red and the id selector matches the id of the h1 element.
